methods_long: Hierarchical semi-parametric nowcasting of right censored hospitalisations by date of positive test. Hospitalisations are modelled using a random walk on the log scale. Reporting delays are then modelled parametrically using a lognormal distribution with the log mean and log standard deviation each modelled using a weekly random walk with a pooled standard deviation and a random effect for the day of the week (introduced on the 6th of December 2021) with public holidays assumed to be reported like Sundays. Report date effects are again modelled using a random effect for day of the week with public holidays assumed to be reported like Sundays. Age groups and locations are nowcast independently. The model is implemented using the epinowcast R package (https://epiforecasts.io/epinowcast). The analysis code is available here: https://github.com/epiforecasts/eval-germany-sp-nowcasting
