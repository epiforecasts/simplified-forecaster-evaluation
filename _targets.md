Analysis pipeline: Evaluating Semi-Parametric Nowcasts of COVID-19
Hospital Admissions in Germany
================
Sam Abbott

# Pipeline

The analysis pipeline for this work can be regenerated by rendering this
file,

``` r
rmarkdown::render("_targets.Rmd")
```

The pipeline can then be run using,

``` r
tar_make()
```

The complete pipeline can be visualised using,

``` r
tar_visnetwork()
```

Alternatively the pipeline can be explored interactively using this
notebook or updated programmatically using the scripts in `bin`. We also
provide an archived version of our `targets` workflow if only wanting to
reproduce sections of our analysis. This can be downloaded using the
following,

``` r
source(here::here("R", "targets-archive.R"))
get_targets_archive()
```

# Setup

Set up the workflow pipeline and options. We first load the `targets`
package and remove the potentially outdated workflow.

``` r
library(targets)
library(tarchetypes)
library(data.table)
library(epinowcast)
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr, quietly = TRUE)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'purrr'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:data.table':
#> 
#>     transpose
library(here)
#> here() starts at /eval-germany-sp-nowcasting
library(future)
library(future.callr)
tar_unscript()
```

We now define shared global options across our workflow and load R
functions from the `R` folder.

``` r
library(targets)
library(tarchetypes)
library(cmdstanr)
library(data.table)
library(epinowcast)
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr, quietly = TRUE)
library(here)
library(future)
library(future.callr)
plan(callr)
functions <- list.files(here("R"), full.names = TRUE)
walk(functions, source)
rm("functions")
set_cmdstan_path()  
tar_option_set(
  packages = c("data.table", "epinowcast", "scoringutils", "ggplot2", "purrr",
               "cmdstanr", "here"),
  deployment = "worker",
  memory = "transient",
  workspace_on_error = TRUE,
  error = "continue",
  garbage_collection = TRUE
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/globals/globals.R.
```

# Ingest data and stratify by location and report date

  - Watch the URL at which hospitalisation data is hosted in order to
    trigger an update to the workflow when new data is uploaded

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_url(
  hospitalisation_url,
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KITmetricslab/hospitalization-nowcast-hub/main/data-truth/COVID-19/COVID-19_hospitalizations_preprocessed.csv" # nolint
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/hospitalisation_url.R.
```

  - Download and process hospitalisation data. Also download and
    combined data on public holidays in Germany.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(hospitalisations, {
  get_germany_hospitalisations(url = hospitalisation_url)
})
#> Define target hospitalisations from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/hospitalisations.R.
```

  - Define date to start nowcasting

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(start_date, {
  as.Date("2021-10-01")
})
#> Define target start_date from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/start_date.R.
```

  - Define dates to nowcast.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(nowcast_dates, {
  unique(
    hospitalisations[reference_date >= start_date]$reference_date
  )
})
#> Define target nowcast_dates from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/nowcast_dates.R.
```

  - Define age groups

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(age_groups, {
  unique(hospitalisations$age_group)
})
#> Define target age_groups from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/age_groups.R.
```

  - Define locations to nowcast using age group data (currently limited
    to just national level).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(locations, {
  "DE"
})
#> Define target locations from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/locations.R.
```

  - Define locations in which to nowcast only for the overall count and
    not for each age group.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(other_locations, {
  setdiff(unique(hospitalisations$location), locations)
})
#> Define target other_locations from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/other_locations.R.
```

  - Define maximum allowed reporting delay (in days).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(max_report_delay, {
  40
})
#> Define target max_report_delay from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/max_report_delay.R.
```

  - Define hospitalisations by date of report. Note that here the target
    is defined to never update if data exists for that nowcast date.
    This is because the truth date for previous days can change slightly
    over time as negative cases are adjusted for leading to spurious
    refits.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(
  hospitalisations_by_date_report,
  enw_retrospective_data(
    hospitalisations,
    rep_date = nowcast_dates,
    ref_days = max_report_delay
  )[, nowcast_date := nowcast_dates],
  map(nowcast_dates),
  iteration = "list",
  cue = tar_cue(mode = "never")
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/hospitalisations_by_date_report.R.
```

  - Define latest available data.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(latest_hospitalisations, {
   enw_latest_data(hospitalisations)
})
#> Define target latest_hospitalisations from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/latest_hospitalisations.R.
```

  - Make latest observations into 7 day incidence.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(latest_7day_hospitalisations, {
  copy(latest_hospitalisations)[,
    confirm := frollsum(confirm, n =  7), by = c("age_group", "location")
  ][!is.na(confirm)]
})
#> Define target latest_7day_hospitalisations from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/latest_7day_hospitalisations.R.
```

  - Define “complete” data (i.e more than 28 days have passed since
    first reported)

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(complete_hospitalisations, {
  latest_hospitalisations[reference_date < (max(reference_date) - 28)]
})
#> Define target complete_hospitalisations from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/complete_hospitalisations.R.
```

  - Similarly, define “complete” 7 day hospitalisation incidence.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(complete_7day_hospitalisations, {
  latest_7day_hospitalisations[reference_date < (max(reference_date) - 28)]
})
#> Define target complete_7day_hospitalisations from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/complete_7day_hospitalisations.R.
```

  - Plot reporting delay percentage by date, location, and age group.

# Fit models and produce nowcasts

## Model and model settings

  - Compile the model for multithread use.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_file(
  epinowcast_model,
  compile_model(),
  deployment = "main"
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/epinowcast_model.R.
```

  - Define stan settings shared across models and used for fitting

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(epinowcast_settings, {
  list(
    save_warmup = FALSE,
    output_loglik = FALSE,
    pp = FALSE,
    iter_warmup = 1000,
    iter_sampling = 1000,
    chains = 2,
    parallel_chains = 2,
    threads_per_chain = 1,
    adapt_delta = 0.95,
    show_messages = FALSE,
    refresh = 0
  )
})
#> Define target epinowcast_settings from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/epinowcast_settings.R.
```

## Priors

  - Define a set of uninformed priors using the defaults from
    `epinowcast`.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(uninformed_priors, {
  enw_priors()
})
#> Define target uninformed_priors from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/uninformed_priors.R.
```

  - Define a set of observations to use as a source for informed priors.
    Here we use overall national hospitalisations and data from the 1st
    of July 2021.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(
  prior_obs,
  enw_retrospective_data(
    hospitalisations[location == "DE"][age_group == "00+"],
    rep_date = as.Date("2021-07-01"), ref_days = max_report_delay
  ),
  cue = tar_cue(mode = "never")
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/prior_obs.R.
```

  - Fit a model to national overall hospitalisations only and extract
    posterior estimates for the delay distribution and overdispersion to
    use as informed priors for other models by assuming a normal
    distribution with their posterior standard deviations scaled by 10
    times.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(priors, {
  do.call(prior_epinowcast, c(
    list(
      prior_obs, max_delay = max_report_delay, scale = 10,
      priors = uninformed_priors
    ),
    epinowcast_settings
  ))
})
#> Define target priors from chunk code.
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/priors.R.
```

## Models

  - Intercept only model.

``` r
tar_target(
  fixed_nowcast,
  nowcast(
    obs = hospitalisations_by_date_report,
    tar_loc = locations,
    model = fixed_epinowcast,
    priors = priors,
    max_delay = max_report_delay,
    settings = epinowcast_settings

    tar_loc = locations,
    model = age_epinowcast,
    priors = priors,
    max_delay = max_report_delay,
    settings = epinowcast_settings
  ),
  cross(hospitalisations_by_date_report, locations),
  cue = tar_cue(mode = "never")
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/age_nowcast.R.
```

  - Age group random effect model with a weekly random walk and a day of
    the week reporting effect.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(
  week_nowcast,
  nowcast(
    obs = hospitalisations_by_date_report,
    tar_loc = locations,
    model = week_epinowcast,
    priors = priors,
    max_delay = max_report_delay,

)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/week_nowcast.R.
```

  - Age group random effect model with an age group specific weekly
    random walk, and a day of the week reporting effect.

<!-- end list -->

``` r

  age_week_nowcast,
  nowcast(
    obs = hospitalisations_by_date_report,
    tar_loc = locations,
    model = age_week_epinowcast,
    priors = priors,
    max_delay = max_report_delay,
    settings = epinowcast_settings
  ),
  cross(hospitalisations_by_date_report, locations),
  cue = tar_cue(mode = "never")
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/age_week_nowcast.R.
```

  - Independent age group model with a weekly random walk and a day of
    the week reporting model.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(
  independent_nowcast,
  nowcast(
    obs = hospitalisations_by_date_report[age_group == age_groups],
    tar_loc = locations,
    model = independent_epinowcast,
    priors = priors,
    max_delay = max_report_delay,
    settings = epinowcast_settings
  ),
  cross(hospitalisations_by_date_report, locations, age_groups),
  cue = tar_cue(mode = "never")
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/independent_nowcast.R.
```

  - Independent age group model with a weekly random walk and a day of
    the week reference and reporting model.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(
  independent_ref_dow_nowcast,
  nowcast(
    obs = hospitalisations_by_date_report[age_group == age_groups],
    tar_loc = locations,

  cue = tar_cue(mode = "never")
)
#> Establish _targets.R and _targets_r/targets/independent_ref_dow_nowcast.R.
```

  - Model for locations without age groups. As for the previous model
    this has a weekly random walk and a day of the week reporting and
    reference model. This was updated on the 6th of December 2021 from
    the independent model without a day of the week effect for reference
    date (to enable this note that we have overridden the default `cue`
    settings here so that once a model has been fit it is never run
    again for that combination of locations and dates regardless of
    upstream changes).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
tar_target(
  overall_only_nowcast,
  nowcast(
    obs = hospitalisations_by_date_report[age_group == "00+"],
    tar_loc = other_locations,
    model = independent_ref_dow_epinowcast,

  - Extract summarised daily nowcast. As a temporary measure here we
    adjust quantiles that are more than 25% of the median when there is
    evidence of a fitting issue (based on divergent transistions and R
    hat values).

  - Define and format the hierarchical nowcast for submission. As a
    temporary measure here we adjust quantiles that are more than 25% of

  - Score daily nowcasts overall, by age group, by horizon, by nowcast
    date, and by reference date on both the natural and log scales
    (corresponding to absolute and relative scoring). These summarised
    scores are then saved to `data/scores`.
