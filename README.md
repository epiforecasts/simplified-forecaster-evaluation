## Dependencies

Dependencies are managed using \[`renv`\].

Alternatively a docker
[container](https://github.com/epiforecasts/simplfied-forecaster-evaluation/blob/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile)
and
[image](https://github.com/epiforecasts/simplfied-forecaster-evaluation/pkgs/container/simplfied-forecaster-evaluation)
is provided. An easy way to make use of this is using the Remote
development extension of `vscode`.
